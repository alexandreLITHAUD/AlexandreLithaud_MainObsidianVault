# Day
This day I am in TT despite all odds. The 4g box that Orange gave me works ok. So its all good. And the technician will come Monday. so I'll be in TT there also.

Yesterday I finished the pipeline refactoring but I still have the feeling that I haven't done much. But this feeling is leaving little by little.

Yesterday there was a fun problem with the dit runners so i debugged with Olivier and it was pretty fun. Its a relief that i could be of that much help.
i learned thanks to him and Lionel more about ssh, ps . like `kill -9 <pid>` `ps -ef` and `pstree` . Also how to use top better `c in top or top -c`. The problem was still up this morning but now I know how to resolve it.
`nohup bash <script> <input> &` -> works like a charm and its a good practice that I need to learn.
Maybe create a Bash note to keeps those kinds of things: [[Bash]]

Today i will merge the refactoring, create Notes, repair the dit runner group and maybe either form myself to new technos or program a it in Go. Or help Leonore with Prometheus and Thanos migration.
